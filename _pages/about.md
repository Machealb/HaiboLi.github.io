Welcome to my website!


I am a research associate in Statistics at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics][MathsStats] at the [University of Glasgow][UoG], working with [Dirk Husmeier][DirkHusmeier] on computer-intensive statistical inference in soft-tissue mechanical models based on partial differential equations. My current post is within the EPSRC funded [Closed-Loop Data Science][CLDS] centre, where I work on incorporating feedback effects into healthcare prognostication systems. My previous position at Glasgow was within [SofTMech][SofTMech], an EPSRC centre for Multiscale Soft Tissue Mechanics with applications to heart and cancer.

 
## Research interests:
My research interests center around utilizing mathematical modeling and computational techniques to address challenging problems arising from scientific computing, matrix computation and data science. These topics include:
- Inverse problems, regularization
- Numerical linear algebra, Matrix analysis and computation
- Scientific machine learning, kernel method
