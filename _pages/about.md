Welcome to my website!

I am currently a Research Fellow in applied mathematics at [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au), [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). My research centers around utilizing mathematical modeling and computational techniques to address challenging problems arising from scientific computing, matrix computation and data science. Mathematics is the main tool in my My work is highly interdisciplinary. I am always looking to collaborate with researchers from mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, high performance computing and etc.
 
## Research interests:
My research interests include:
- Inverse problems, regularization
- Numerical linear algebra, Matrix analysis and computation
- Scientific machine learning, kernel method

Many other topics are also related to my research, such as numerical optimization, numerical PDEs, and statistical learning.
